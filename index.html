                <h5 class="card-title">Bio</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Since the beginning of my life I was very eager to know how things worked, and just know the explanation. I just loved to know the answer of each question.
                    When I was very young I developed interest in Science and Math, and later on, during University I was very fond of programing and how to use different programs in order to achieve some goal. Any homework that involved some sort of programing I was eager to do, and offered myself to do the programming while others wrote or do other stuff. 
                    At some point on University, I got ill and got myself an “Arduino”, and learned how to use it, and I just totally loved it. Then I searched for Arduino sensors and there was a HUGE WORLD of sensors and I was very fond of them. I was very updated on what sensors existed, their prices, and at this time I was taking a class on Campus called “Ubicuous Computation”, and it totally blew my mind. On that class we saw the future literally, and I loved it. So I did the obvious thing to do (for me at least), wich was making for the final proyect of the class a really automated device, so I did an Arduino based Hydroponic Controller and that was my final project and it was very fun to make, the whole process I just totally loved it.
                    Later on, I graduated and then, worked as an Analyst for two different places and on each there were a lot of repetitive work, and during my free time I tried to develop solutions for them. Some of those succeed and it was very fun to make.
                    Finally, on 2018, I was let go from the last job because business was very bad and they had to let go a lot of people. At this point I decided that I wanted to make my own stuff, from scratch, the way I like. I got myself a 3D printer without any previous knowledge on design, 3D or anything related to it, and learned how to design 3D, learned woodworking, and since my mother knew a lot of how to make chocolates, I started making 3D prints and made molds out of them in order to make any shape and size of Chocolates. I also started updating my hydroponic controller and started making it an automated device to make hydroponics, not just a simple controller. 
                    Nowadays I consider myself a maker. I like to create my own things and now I am learning lots of new programing skills on the MIT professional certificate in coding: Full Stack Development with MERN. I am eager to know what projects I will be tomorrow, do you have one you think you need a maker? Maybe you should contact me. Who knows.
